Within the Historical Reports TAB you can build, schedule, share and export historical reports without any restrictions on time period. YTD, QTD, MTD and numerous other relative time filters. Export in excel (.xlxs), share with private URL’s and ConnectPath’s instant messaging.

### Create Report

Fill out the `Name`, `Report Period` input fields, and click on the `Run report now` button. You can also filter reports by `Queues`.

### Schedule Report

You can also **Schedule** the release of reports (by day, week, month) and set up the delivery of these by sending a notification to an Email.

### Report Dashboard

At the top side of the page you can see different details (`Timezone`, `Report time period`) and both a `Download` and `Close` button. The report also displays a summary table with general metrics: `All`, `Handled`, `Abandoned`, `Total Time Queued`, `ASA`, `AACW`, `AHT`,  `Total Time Talking`, `Holds`, `Total Time on Hold`, `Longest Hold`, `Avg. Abandon Time` and `Missed`.

#### Charts - All, Queue, Agent, Hour and Channel Distribution

These are charts displaying the amount of contacts the instance has perceived between a set of different metrics (number of contacts handled by queue, agent, contacts within an specific hour...) in the selected period of time. Each of these has the option to be downloaded either as a **csv**, **svg**, or **png** file.

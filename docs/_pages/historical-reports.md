### Report Dashboard

At the top side of the page you can see different details (`Generated`, `Time period`, `Requestor` and `Filters`) and an `Action` button that allows you to either build a schedule, or export the report as a PDF file. The report is also composed of 7 different tabs: Summary, DNIS Detail, Queue Detail, Agent Detail, Disposition Detail, Transfer Detail and Hourly Detail.

#### Summary

The summary tab shows general metrics and charts you can look at to ease the process of keeping track of your Call Center. You can see the agent who has the most influence per period, or the queue that is most active by looking at the `Agent Distribution` and `Queue Distribution` graphs respectively.

You can also look at the amount of contacts attended with Contacts by Interval (Months, Weeks or Days).

Within the Historical Reports TAB you can build, schedule, share and export historical reports without any restrictions on time period. YTD, QTD, MTD and numerous other relative time filters. Export in PDF, share with private URL’s and Dextr Flex’s instant messaging.

#### Create Report

At the top right corner of the dashboard you can click the `Create Report` button to build an historical report. Fill out the `Name`, `Date Range` input fields, and customize them by `Queues` and `Channels`.

#### Report Dashboard

At the top side of the page you can see different details belonging to the report (`Generated`, `Time period`, `Requestor` and `Filters`) and an `Action` button. The report is also composed of 4 different tabs: Summary, DNIS Detail, Queue Detail and Agent Detail.

##### Summary

The summary tab shows general metrics and charts you can look at to ease the understanding, and keep track of the ongoing status of your Call Center. You can see the agent who has the most influence per period, or the queue that is most active by looking at the `Agent Distribution` and `Queue Distribution` graphs respectively. You can also look at the amount of contacts attended with Contacts by Interval (Months, Weeks or Days).

##### DNIS

This is a customizable table (you can customize it by clicking the `Configure Table` button) containing metrics filtered by DNIS.

The table contains details about: `Contacts Handled`, `Missed`, `Avg. Talk Time`, `Talk Time`, `Avg. ACW`, `Holds`, `Holds Duration` and `Longest Hold`. 

##### Queue Detail

Also a customizable table that contains metrics filtered by Queue and Agent. The table contains details about: `Contacts Handled`, `Missed`, `Avg. Talk Time`, `Talk Time`, `Avg. ACW`, `Holds`, `Holds Duration`, `Longest Hold` and `Abandoned`.

##### Agent Detail

The last of the customizable tables. This table contains metrics filtered by Agent and contains details about: `Contacts Handled`, `Missed`, `Avg. Talk Time`, `Talk Time`, `Avg. ACW`, `Holds`, `Holds Duration` and `Longest Hold`.

##### Action

By clicking the Action button, you're able to either **Export** the table as a PDF, or **Schedule** the release of reports (by day, week, month). You can also set up a delivery by Email.

### Login page

The Login process is the same for all ConnectPath dashboard users.  It assumes that your Amazon Connect Instance administrator has gone through the [Onboarding](/onboarding/) process.  Once this has been accomplished you will be given a login URL that is in the format of **https://go.dextrflex.com/yourcompanylogin** and can click the Secure Login button.

You can also login by going to **https://go.dextrflex.com**  and entering the name of the Instance chosen by your Administrator. In this example **thedarkside** was typed in the Instance Alias field.

### Allowing microphone use in ConnectPath

If you are using the Softphone options, with a headset plugged in to a USB port on your computer, you MUST grant ConnectPath permission to use your microphone and sound options or you will not be able to change your status to AVAILABLE or participate in calls.

When entering ConnectPath without granting permission to use your microphone, ConnectPath will remind you to please grant access whenever you try to make a call or change your Agent Status.

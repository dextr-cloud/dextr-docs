The Engage TAB is one of Dextr main features since it's the place where you'll be having your calls. The left side consists of the dialpad (Figure 1. Component 1), while the right side consists of Recent Calls (Figure 1. Component 2) and Favorites (Figure 1. Component 3).

### Dialpad

Here you can type, paste or click the dialpad numbers to input a phone number and make a call. Remember to have the correct country code. When on call, you also have the option to put it on hold.

#### Call Transfers

You can also do a call transfers, which can be either **Blind** or **Warm**. 

**Blind** transfers gets the call on a selected Queue, making the contact wait until is taken by the next Available agent while also leaving you completely out of the call. 

**Warm** transfers on the other hand, allows you to remain and monitor the call when another agent takes it.

#### Call dispositions

If the administrator has this option on, when call ends you'll notice a modal window showing up. The modal window will prompt you to select one of the dispositions in the dropdown to keep track of what the call consisted of. This makes assessments and inquiry easier when checking the [Activity](/activity/) tab for a specific call.

If you don't select a disposition when timer ends, then no disposition will be assigned to the call.

### SMS & Email

**SMS** is for text message routing while **Email** is for inbound Email routing. When a contact sends an email to the Instance, an incoming modal window will show up asking you for permission to engage with the contact. If you accept then the email will be routed to your inbox (email assigned to your Dextr account), and you'll also be able to see the email conversation within Dextr Engage tab.

Important to note is that you're unable to write answers from Dextr. To answer, you must do so with your email account outside of Dextr.

### Recent Calls

This panel keeps a track of all your calls. All calls have a label and a timestamp assigned to them. Inbound, Outbound and Missed calls will be registered as such.

If you right click any of the records, you can either copy the number or call it. By clicking a record you'll trigger the modal call window.

Dextr is able to use both native Operating System and Chrome notifications for incoming contacts. If the notification doesn't show up there are a few settings to check:

#### Chrome Flags 

Head over to ***chrome://flags/*** and make sure that system notifications are enabled if you want to use your OS notifications.

If disabled, you'll receive Chrome notifications instead.

### Window Settings

If you're in Windows, you also need to make sure that Chrome notifications are on.

#### Chrome Settings

If you're still not receiving notifications, you want to ensure that ***https://go.dextrflex.com*** is allowed to send notifications through Chrome. You can check that by going to ***chrome://settings/content/notifications?search=notification*** and confirm that sites can ask for permission to send notifications. On login Dextr asks for permission but it is up to you to allow it.

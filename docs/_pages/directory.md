### Contact creation

You create contacts by clicking the **Create** button. When creating contacts, you'll be asked to fill both the Name field and the Phone number as a requirement. When a contact is created you can click him from your Directory, which  will open a new window in your right side where you can: call, edit, delete or mark it as favorite.

#### Edit and Deletion of contacts

By clicking the **Edit** option you can add more information, change it, or delete one of the fields. To **delete a contact**, you just click the trashcan icon and confirm. After deletion, you can still create contacts that previously had the same information.

#### Favoriting contacts

This option will mark the contact from your Personal list as Favorite. This will enable you to see and quickly reach your Favorite contacts for calling in the Engage tab. The star icon will get green coloured when the contact is added as Favorite.

### Contact creation

You create contacts by clicking the **Create** button. When creating contacts, you'll be asked to fill both the Name field and the Phone number as a requirement. 

When a contact is created you can click him from your Directory, which  will open a new window in your right side where you can: call, edit, delete or mark it as favorite.

#### Global contacts

By clicking the global checkbox when creating a contact, you create global entries/contacts that all agents in the Instance can see from their directory.

- If you're a Supervisor, you can also **edit or delete** global contacts no matter who created them. Removing the **Global status** will also return the previously global contact to the creator Personal list.

### Contact creation

You create contacts by clicking the **Create** button. When creating contacts, you'll be asked to fill both the Name field and the Phone number as a requirement. 

When a contact is created you can click him from your Directory, which  will open a new window in your right side where you can: call, edit, delete or mark it as favorite.

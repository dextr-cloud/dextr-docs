Directory is your personal contact list. You might use this to personalize your experience working as an agent.

### Contact creation

When creating contacts, you'll be asked to fill both the Name field and the Phone number as a requirement. When contact is created you can click him from your Directory, that will open a new window in your right side where you can: call, edit, delete or favorite the contact.

#### Editing contacts

You can click this option to either add more information, correct it, or delete one of the fields.

#### Deleting contacts

You can click this option to delete the contact from your Directory. After deletion, you can still create a contact with the same information.

#### Favoriting contacts

This option will move the contact from your Personal list to your Favorite list. Doing so will enable the Favorite panel in the Engage TAB, allowing to see and quickly reach your Favorite contacts for calling.

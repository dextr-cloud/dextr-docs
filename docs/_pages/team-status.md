This is a ConnectPath component that can be displayed in every ConnectPath TAB. It shows you other agents assigned to your queue or routing profile. 

### Right click menu

You can right click each agent to engage either in chat, a call, or add them as favorites.

#### Favorites

By clicking this option you add agents as Favorites. This will put them on the top side of the Team Status. If an agent is already favorited, you can Unfavorite them any time.

#### Call (Peer to Peer call)

You're able to call agents who are online (either Available or in a custom status provided by the Instance Admin). These calls redirect you to the conversation UI and are recorded in ***My Perfomance** in the Recent Activity/Internal (Peer) tab.

#### Silent Monitor and Whisper Coach

When an agent is on call and you see the **Connected** status in the Team Drawer, after a right click you have the option to either Silent Monitor or Whisper Coach.

- ***Silent Monitor*** allows you to silently hear the call between the agent and the contact.
- ***Whisper Coach*** allows you to whisper/speak with the agent without the contact being able to hear you.

### Recent Activity

This tab includes your general perfomance through the day and displays your activity.

#### My Perfomance

This shows your perfomance. It displays the amount of ACD (Automatic Call Distributor) and Peer to Peer (Agent to Agent) calls you've had during the day. How many you've handled, missed, and the total talk time.

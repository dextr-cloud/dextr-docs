### First Look

The first thing you'll notice when login into Dextr is that there are a lot of components showing up. At the top of the screen there is a header (Figure 1 - Component 1). At the right corner there is a Team Status Drawer (Figure 1 - Component 2) and in the left corner a Side Navigation bar (Figure 1 - Component 3) that allows you to travel around Dextr main tabs and components.

### Header

This is a global section of Dextr that will always be displayed. You can always see your Agent Status, a Handset, a Bell and the Instance logo.

#### Agent Status

On login you're offline, so remember to change your Status from Offline to Available to be able to receive calls.  By default every Dextr Instance only has 2 status at the beginning, "Available" and "Offline", if you see "Forced Released" as a status is because you missed an incoming call sent to your dashboard. 

Your Dextr Administrator may also enable other codes for you to select as your current status and as seen by your teammates.

#### Quick Dial

The Handset is for quick dial. You can either type or paste a number (Figure 3), and after a calls you'll have a dropdown list with the phone numbers of the recent calls you've made. Remember to choose the proper flag for calling.

### Home Dashboard & Cards

This area is for the display of real time metrics for all queues in near real time activity. Clicking on a queue name in the dropdown will show the metrics for that queue while the Global view summarizes all queues. 

In the top corner of Home dashboard you can also spot 2 icons in the right corner, one for entering fullscreen and another to rearrange your card placement.

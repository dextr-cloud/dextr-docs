### First Look

The first thing you'll notice when login into Dextr is that there are a lot of components showing up. At the top of the screen there is a header (Figure 1 - Component 1). At the right corner there is a Team Status Drawer (Figure 1 - Component 2) and in the left corner a Side Navigation bar (Figure 1 - Component 3) that allows you to travel around Dextr main tabs and components.

### Header

This is a global section of Dextr that will always be displayed. You'll see your Agent Status, a Handset, a Bell and the Instance logo.

#### Agent Status

Every Dextr Instance only has 2 status after being onboarded: **Available** and **Offline**. By default your status is set to ***Offline*** on login, so remember to change your status from ***Offline*** to ***Available*** to be able to receive calls. Also, if you see **Forced Released** as a status is because you missed an incoming call sent to your dashboard. 

Your Dextr Administrator may also enable other status for you to select and to be seen by your teammates.

#### Quick Dial


The Handset is for quick dial. You can either type or paste a number (Figure 3), and after a call you'll have a dropdown list with the phone numbers of the recent calls you've made. Remember to choose the proper flag for calling.

#### Announcements

By clicking the Bell icon in the header, you'll open the Announcements. Here you can see all the announcements related to your queue. If you're an admin, you will be able to post announcements by clicking the pencil icon in the bottom side.

### Home Dashboard & Cards
----

This area is for the display of real time metrics for all queues in near real time activity. Clicking on a queue name in the dropdown will show the metrics for that queue while the Global view summarizes all queues. 

In the top corner of Home dashboard you can also spot 2 icons at the right side, one for entering fullscreen mode and another one to rearrange your card placement.

#### My Recent Activity

On this card a list of all your activity through the day will be shown as records. You'll see Inbound, Outbound and even your Missed calls. Everytime you make a call or receive one, the list will update.

You can also click any of the records, and choose the option to call the specified number which will trigger a modal window, allowing you to engage in a call. Below you'll see some retailer names instead of phone numbers because they were added as contacts in the [Directory](/directory/) TAB.

### Team Status Drawer
----

A Dextr component that displays other agents assigned to your queue or routing profile. You can right click each agent to engage either in chat, a call, or add them as favorites so that they're displayed at the top.

You also have the option to hide offline agents or to display all of them.

#### Silent Monitor and Whisper Coach

When an agent is on call and you see the **Connected** status in the Team Drawer, after a right click you have the option to either Silent Monitor or Whisper Coach.

**Silent Monitor** allows you to silently hear the call between the agent and the contact, while **Whisper Coach** allows you to whisper/speak with the agent without the contact being able to hear you.

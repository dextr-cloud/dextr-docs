### First Look

The first thing you'll notice when login into Dextr is that there are a lot of components showing up. At the top of the screen there is a header (Figure 1. Component 1). At the right corner there is a Team Status Drawer (Figure 1. Component 2) and in the left corner a Side Navigation bar (Figure 1. Component 3) that allows you to travel around Dextr main tabs and components.

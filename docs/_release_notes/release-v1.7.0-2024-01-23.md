## ConnectPath Release Notes, January 2024
  
Advanced Notice: With this release (v1.7.0) there are a few things to note:
 
We will hide the old Activity Search, via a permission, in the next release (v1.8.0). This was previously communicated as v1.7.0 but we have pushed it one more release to give customers time to review the added capabilities in the new activity search.
We had previously communicated that we would be introducing a change in the login flow for ConnectPath users in a subsequent hotfix after release v1.6.0 and before January 1st, 2024. Based on guidance from AWS prior to January 1st, 2024, this change was not introduced as Chrome is temporarily (1 year) allow listing Amazon Connect domains while a permanent solution is implemented by AWS. Further communication on this topic will be after Q1 2024, before Q3 2024.
Tentatively, in v1.8.0, we will be reverting the current blind transfer behavior, in which the called party must answer before the blind transfer completes, for instances that do not have early media enabled. This was introduced as a workaround to an Amazon Connect defect, for which a more permanent solution is being identified.
 
Note that there will be a subsequent release (v1.7.1) approximately two weeks after this release, primarily consisting of general improvements to ConnectPath, based on customer feedback, as well as one new feature, release notes will be shared 1 week prior to the release or approximately on Tuesday, January 30th, 2024.
 
As a reminder to customers, with a previous release we have added support for customers to use the go.connectpath.cx domain instead of the go.dextrflex.com domain. While our intentions are not to immediately disable the go.dextrflex.com domain, we do anticipate at some point in the future we will aim to do so (with prior communication) and encourage our customers to make the changes to support that domain. These changes may include updating their identity provider relay state, updating their end usersâ€™ bookmarks, updating their firewall settings (more details can be found here https://docs.dextr.cloud/system-requirements/), as well as updating their CORS rules in any S3 buckets used by ConnectPath.
 
Finally, if your Amazon Connect instance still uses the legacy URL (*.awsapps.com) and you wish to update your instance to use the new URL (*.my.connect.aws), you may request this change via our Service Desk.

## ConnectPath Release Notes, October 2023
 
Advanced Notice: With the December 2023 Release (v.1.6.0) there will be a few significant changes:

1) We will hide the old Activity Search behind a new permission
2) We will introduce a change in the login flow for ConnectPath users. This change in flow is a result of Google's [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline) initiative, in which Google Chrome has announced plans to block third-party cookies (that is, cookies passed between two top level domains). As ConnectPath uses the Amazon Connect CCP for authentication and the Amazon Connect CCP uses cookies for authentication the change will be implemented to work around this change to Google Chrome. After this change users will be prompted at first login and every 30 days to allow storage access to Cookies in Chrome which allows ConnectPath to continue using third party cookies. Additional communication will be sent out as we get closer to this release but customers can read more about it here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/admin-3pcookies.html
3) We will be reverting the current blind transfer behavior, in which the called party must answer before the blind transfer completes. This was introduced as a workaround to an Amazon Connect defect, for which a more permanent solution has been identified.

Prior Notice:

As a reminder to customers, with a previous release we have added support for customers to use the go.connectpath.cx domain instead of the go.dextrflex.com domain. While our intentions are not to immediately disable the go.dextrflex.com domain, we do anticipate at some point in the future we will aim to do so (with prior communication) and encourage our customers to make the changes to support that domain. These changes may include updating their identity provider relay state, updating their end usersâ€™ bookmarks, updating their firewall settings (more details can be found here https://docs.dextr.cloud/system-requirements/), as well as updating their CORS rules in any S3 buckets used by ConnectPath.

## Dextr Release Notes, January 2020
### Supported Browsers: 

Google Chrome Version 75.0.3770.100 or later. Welcome to the January 2020 release of Dextr. 

There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you like, and some of the key highlights include: 

### Ad-hoc Quick-Connects

Directory entries created in Dextr are now Amazon Connect quick connects. This allows agents to use them for transfer and conference destinations while on a call.

### Team Status Durations 

The team status drawer now shows status durations alongside each team member’s current status. You can check more information about this in the [Team Status Drawer](/teamStatus/) section.

### New Activity filters

Filter current activity result set by Channel (Voice, Chat, Email, SMS and Callbacks), by Queued and Connected Durations. You can check more information about this in [Activity](/activity/).

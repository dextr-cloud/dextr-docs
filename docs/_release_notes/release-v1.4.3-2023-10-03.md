## ConnectPath Release Notes, October 2023
 
Advanced Notice: With the December 2023 Release (v.1.6.0) there will be a few significant changes:
 
We will hide the old Activity Search

We will introduce a change in the login flow for ConnectPath users. This change in flow is a result of Google's [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline) initiative, in which Google Chrome has announced plans to block third-party cookies (that is, cookies passed between two top level domains). As ConnectPath uses the Amazon Connect CCP for authentication and the Amazon Connect CCP uses cookies for authentication the change will be implemented to work around this change to Google Chrome. After this change users will be prompted at first login and every 30 days to allow storage access to Cookies in Chrome which allows ConnectPath to continue using third party cookies. Additional communication will be sent out as we get closer to this release but customers can read more about it here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/admin-3pcookies.html

We are tracking an issue with Cold/Blind Transfers, where a workaround was added to ConnectPath in the May 2023 release, in which we wait for the called party to answer before completing the transfer. We understand this is hindering our customers and are working with AWS to address. As there is not estimation of when a permanent fix will be available, we are hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of that fix in this release and are including it here as a placeholder.

Prior Notice:

As a reminder to customers, with a previous release we have added support for customers to use the go.connectpath.cx domain instead of the go.dextrflex.com domain. While our intentions are not to immediately disable the go.dextrflex.com domain, we do anticipate at some point in the future we will aim to do so (with prior communication) and encourage our customers to make the changes to support that domain. These changes may include updating their identity provider relay state, updating their end usersâ€™ bookmarks, updating their firewall settings (more details can be found here https://docs.dextr.cloud/system-requirements/), as well as updating their CORS rules in any S3 buckets used by ConnectPath.

### BREAKING CHANGE: Add a feature in which the selection of "All" queues in Adhoc/Holiday Closures will be treated as the literal all
HAR-2801

A feature has been added in which the selection of "All" queues in Adhoc/Holiday Closures will be treated as the literal all, in other words, all queues past, present and future. Prior to this release All selected all queues that existed at the time All was selected and the schedule either created or updated. In the case of multiple, overlapping schedules in which All is selected, the oldest (creation date) schedule will be used. We refer to this as a breaking a breaking change as some customers may need to evaluate schedules where they previously selected "All" and ensure that all queues, current and future, should have the schedule applied and that no overlapping schedules exist as a result. For customers where All is not used, no changes are required/no impact is anticipated.

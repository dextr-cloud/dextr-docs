## Dextr Release Notes, September 2019
### Supported Browsers: 

Google Chrome Version 75.0.3770.100 or later  Welcome to the September 2019 release of Dextr. 

There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you like, and some of the key highlights include: 

### Whisper Coach agents on active calls 

Simply right click a team member who is on a call and you will see two new options: Silent Monitor and Whisper Coach.

### Agent's current status is more prominent 

We found sometimes agents did not know they were offline. There is a much clearer colored area in the header showing current status.

### Show phone type in header 

Easily see if configured for soft phone or desk phone.

### Free form disposition input

If enabled by admin, you're now able to write a disposition after a call.

### Team status drawer shows all users in a Connect instance 

Now that there are favoriting and filtering methods, we can organize this list as necessary. You can do so by clicking the following button shown in the picture:

### There is also:

- Reduced network utilization. 
- Routing Profile changes reflect much sooner (much improved reactivity between Connect changes and Dextr changes).
- Filter Activity by Callbacks (also improved styling).
- UI rebuild for SMS and Email contact handling. 
- Sort LiveLook durations independent of queue name. 
- LiveLook calls are removed onAnswer instead of onPresented. 
- Report on all calls.

The Default setting matches the current behavior (showing the past 24 hours of activity). This was requested under CS0025641.

## Defects

----
### Correct a behavior in which a field containing ID may be overwritten in the API call to Dynamics when using the Dynamics integration
A defect has been corrected where a field containing "ID" may be overwritten in the API call to Dynamics when using the Dynamics Integration.

----
### Correct a behavior in which a missed call may not force close the incoming contact modal
A defect has been corrected where a missed call may not force close the incoming contact modal. In some cases, we have Observed where the timer in the incoming call modal (this presents the accept and reject call options), does not match with the Connecting timer which would present to agents like they still have time to answer a call even though the 20 second timer to answer a call has expired. With this update we will be removing the timer from the incoming call modal to prevent a scenario leading to missed calls. You can still see the Connecting status timer in the upper right-hand side of the screen and users will need to use that timer to determine how much time they have to answer a call (This timer counts from 0 up to 20).

----

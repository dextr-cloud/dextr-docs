 The Dashboard provides features that range from omni-channel solutions including Voice, SMS, and Email routing to monitoring and coaching, call disposition code, team status displays, team chat and voice calls, holiday schedules and “ad hoc” queue closings for team meetings with custom caller prompts. Dextr enables supervisors to monitor and coach team members during an active phone call.  Collaboration is achieved by enabling Agent to Agent chat or voice calls.

### Introduction

Dextr is “permission based” which means that an user dashboard with the Agent security profile may not have all of the TABS and Options outlined in this Guide, so check with your Dextr Administrator as to which permissions your dashboard may have.  

All users Dashboard will have the Home, Engage, Activity and Directory tabs, though these also populate with permission-based options. Dextr Administrators will have an expanded Setting tab that includes a Security tab for issuing permissions to users. 

Dextr also can be shaped and moved around to suit your screen real estate requirements, since the dashboard is auto sized depending on the device you are using to view it (e.g. iPad, Smart Phone, computer screen).
